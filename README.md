# Creating a state machine diagram for the instrument booking system as described can help visualize the flow and transitions between different states. Here's a textual representatio of the state machine:

### Initial State (Available)

The instrument is available for booking.

### Actions:
A user can book the instrument, moving it to the "Booked" state.

### Booked State

The instrument is booked by a user.
### Actions:
The user can cancel the booking, returning it to the "Available" state.
The super user can approve the booking, which keeps it in the "Booked" state but may trigger additional processes (like location specification).
The user can request to release the instrument, moving it to the "Releasing" state.
The super user can reject the booking, moving it to the "Rejected" state.

### Releasing State

The instrument is in the process of being released.
### Actions:
The super user can approve the release, returning it to the "Available" state and specifying the new location. If the release is not approved, it returns to the "Booked" state.

### Rejected State

The booking of the instrument is rejected.

### Actions:
The user is notified, and the instrument returns to the "Available" state.
